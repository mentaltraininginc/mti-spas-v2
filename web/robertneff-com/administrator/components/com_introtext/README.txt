IntroText is a quick way to link an intro content to any menu in a site, 
whether it is a component, a section or a static text.
It consist of two parts: a component to create the links between
the static content and the menu and a module to display it.

The folllowing steps have to be done to make it work:
1) Install IntroText component.
2) Create a category and add content text explaining each 
menu item you want to have an introductory text
3) Go to the config option and select that category.
4) Then go back to the main window and add links
between content and menu item.
5) Install IntroText module and place it over the mainbody 
of your template
6) Set module parameters (they're similar to those of Newsflash
module since it's based on it) 
7) Done! You have an intro text in each place you want to!

You can also add more than one intro text per item and if you're
a user of Mambelfish component, multilingual will show off too.

Hope you find it as useful as I do! 

AND NOW AS USUAL... SOME TIPS!

SHOW IMAGES PROBLEM IN MAMBO 4.5.1A:
I found this issue researching into the Mambo core code
and I've validated it through some post in forums.
As the module is based on Newsflash module and this module
use a core Mambo function to show the content on screen, 
I have to warn you about the small bug inside Mambo wich is:

* If you choose to show content images, whether in IntroText or 
Newsflash modules, images won't show on.
* But if you add two images, the second one you've added will be 
displayed on frontend.

So that's it, it's not such a critical bug, but if you want to show images
with your IntroText, just add first any image and then add the real 
one you would like to display.

IF YOU DON'T WANT A BIG HOLE BEFORE YOUR CONTENT WHEN
YOU DON'T HAVE AN INTROTEXT IN A SECTION:
Just go to the module config and select where you want to show the module
in the "Module Positions" option.
