			<h1>&quot;I Would Highly Recommend Dr. Neff&quot;&nbsp;</h1> <h4>I don't even know where to begin to try and talk about all the benefits that I gained from working with Dr. Neff.&nbsp; I think the&nbsp; biggest benefit though was that Dr. Neff instilled in me the life lesson that to be successful in anything in life, you have to want&nbsp; it more than anybody else.&nbsp; However, if you are going to say that&nbsp; you want it more than anybody else,&nbsp; then you have to be willing to be the hardest worker.<br />  </h4> <h4>I would say that my perfomance was more than enhanced by Dr.&nbsp; Neff.&nbsp; He agreed to work with me and told me that if I was coachable and did all the things that he thought were best for me, then I would reach my goals.&nbsp; I would highly recommend Dr. Neff because I know he has the abilities to help other performers make improvements and I know and understand how his program works.&nbsp; He is very professional but at&nbsp; the same time very caring for his clients.&nbsp; His passion is apparent in everything that he does, and that is what makes him stand out above the rest.&nbsp; I look back at everything I accomplished in my tennis career in such a short time period and I know that I owe all of it to Dr. Neff.<br />  </h4> <h4>He did everything he could for me to help me achieve my goals in tennis.&nbsp; At the same time he did so&nbsp; much for me off the court I can't even begin to tell you the influence that he has had on my life and how he has helped me become the person I&nbsp; am today.&nbsp; Dr. Neff taught me that if you are willing to work as hard as you possibly can then there is no goal that you can't&nbsp; reach.&nbsp; That is something that I will carry with me for the rest&nbsp; of my life.&nbsp; I know that Dr. Neff would give the time and dedication to other clients as he did for me because I know there is nothing more gratifying for him then to see his clients succeed.</h4> <h4>Caleb Bachelor</h4> <h4>Cedar Hill, Texas</h4> <h4>Tennis<br />  </h4>			</td>
